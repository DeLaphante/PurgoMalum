# PurgoMalum Test Suite

## Overview

This project tests the PurgoMalum service, which provides profanity filtering for text via JSON, XML, and plain endpoints. The test suite uses [Reqnroll](https://reqnroll.net/) (a fork of SpecFlow) for BDD-style feature testing, integrated with MSTest as the test runner.
